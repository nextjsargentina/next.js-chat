# NextJS-Chat ðŸ’¬

## Overview

NextJS-Chat, developed by [Next.js Argentina](https://github.com/nextjsargentina), is designed to facilitate interaction with the `nextjs-docs` repository. Utilizing a dataset from the app-router version of Next.js 14, it integrates a chat interface from [chatbotui.com](https://www.chatbotui.com/). This setup, combined with llama-index, OpenAI, and ChatGPT technologies, allows users to freely interact with a virtual expert on frontend development, React, and best practices in Next.js. Targeting new developers with no previous experience or knowledge, NextJS-Chat aims to educate on Next.js and the principles of clean code and design patterns.
